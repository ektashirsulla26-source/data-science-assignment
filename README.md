This project analyzes crypto trading behavior under different market sentiment conditions (Fear vs. Greed). Using the Fear &amp; Greed Index and real trader transaction data, we study how traders adjust their strategies, risk, and position sizes across sentiment regimes.
The final deliverables include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of sentiment and trading activity
- Comparisons of trading volume & position sizes on Fear vs. Greed days
- Leverage usage analysis â€“ Do traders risk more during Greed markets?
- Performance metrics (PnL, win rate, average trade size)
- Visual outputs (charts, plots, heatmaps) stored in outputs/
- Final PDF report (ds_report.pdf) summarizing insights, visuals, and statistics
